- Measure the throughput of each endpoint by gradually increasing the number of concurrent users and monitoring the response time.
- Analyze how the throughput varies with increasing user load to identify any performance bottlenecks.
- Measure the response time of each endpoint under different load conditions.
- Monitor the server resource utilization  to ensure that the server can handle the load efficiently without exceeding its capacity.
- Conduct stress testing by increasing the load beyond the expected capacity of the server.
- Evaluate the system's ability to handle sudden increases in load without crashing or experiencing significant performance degradation.
- Conduct soak testing by maintaining a constant load on each endpoint for an extended period (e.g., several hours).
- Introduce errors to observe how the system handles them under load.
- Measure the error rate and analyze error responses to ensure they are handled gracefully without impacting overall system performance.
- Test the throughput of each endpoint with varying sizes of request payloads.
- Test the maximum number of concurrent sessions that each endpoint can handle efficiently.
- Measure the system's performance in terms of response time and throughput as the number of concurrent sessions increases.
